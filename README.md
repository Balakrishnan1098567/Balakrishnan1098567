Hi there! I'm an aspiring embedded systems developer passionate about bringing innovative ideas to life through hardware and software.
I'm constantly exploring the intersection of these two worlds, and I'm eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology.

My focus areas include:
Microcontroller programming: Proficient in C/C++ for efficient and resource-constrained systems.

Embedded Linux: Experience with Linux kernel configuration, device drivers, and system integration.

Real-time operating systems (RTOS): Familiarity with RTOS concepts and their application in embedded systems.

Hardware design: Basic understanding of digital logic design and PCB layout.

I'm always open to collaboration, learning new things, and taking on challenging projects.
Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of my work. 
Let's connect and build something great together!
